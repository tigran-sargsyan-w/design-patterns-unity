# Factory Method
## *Intent*
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

## *Applicability*
Use the Factory Method when you don’t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with.

The Factory Method separates product construction code from the code that actually uses the product. Therefore it’s easier to extend the product construction code independently from the rest of the code.

For example, to add a new product type to the app, you’ll only need to create a new creator subclass and override the factory method in it.

## *How to implement*
1. Make all products follow the same interface. This interface should declare methods that make sense in every product.
2. Add an empty factory method inside the creator class. The return type of the method should match the common product interface.
3. In the creator’s code find all references to product constructors. One by one, replace them with calls to the factory method, while extracting the product creation code into the factory method.
4. Now, create a set of creator subclasses for each type of product listed in the factory method. Override the factory method in the subclasses and extract the appropriate bits of construction code from the base method.
